## Projects:

### BitTiger_DS501

### Capital_bikeshare_rental_demand

### Ericsson online assessment

### MNIST
* Use only 5000 records to build models for MNIST
* Use different models
  * Non-linear SVM, linear SVM
  * Logistic regression
  * Decision tree
  * Ada Boost, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest
  * kNN, Bagged kNN
  * Naive Bayes
  * Neural network
* Use gray scale and black-and-white to build models and check the model performances.

### Music_Box

### Reboot_Box-Plots_for_Education

### Sensors_data

### Titanic

### Uber_rider_churn_prediction
* Apply data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to select the useful features for building models.
* Load the cleaned data and build different models to see the performances for different models.
* Use models:
  * Logistic regression
  * Single decision tree
  * Bagged trees
  * Single kNN
  * Bagged kNN
  * Random forest
  * Gradient boosting trees
  * Neural network
  * Linear SVM
  * Non-linear SVM
* Apply grid search on the random forest model to find the best hyperparameters.

### Upstart_loan_charge-off_rate_prediction
* Upstart online assessment
